# Overview
Integration with Service Bus and Event Grid

Microsoft Azure Service Bus is a fully managed enterprise message broker with message queues and publish-subscribe topics. Service Bus is used to decouple applications and services from each other, providing the following benefits:

 * Load-balancing work across competing workers
 * Safely routing and transferring data and control across service and application boundaries
 * Coordinating transactional work that requires a high-degree of reliability
