# Overview
DevOps for Logic Apps, Azure Functions, and API Management

# Challenges

1. Implement source control and a CI/CD solution.

2. The solution should deploy the Program Feedback API when there is a change to the "main" branch, and the build is successful.

3. Successful builds should require approval before being pushed to Azure.

4. Create a "Blue Green" deployment approach with GitHub actions.
